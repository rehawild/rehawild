Here's a list of things I currently keep myself busy with:
🌱 **Learning game development** in Godot and building my game development portfolio  
💼 **Exploring control systems**, **AI**, and **PLC programming**  
🎨 **Creating pixel art** (2D & 3D) for games and NFTs

## 🎮 Game Development in Godot
I'm learning and building games with **Godot**, an open-source game engine. My goal is to master it and develop various games, from 2D platformers to complex systems involving **AI**, **control theory**, and **simulation**. I'm always experimenting and improving my skills to create engaging experiences.

## 🛠️ Skills & Technologies
- **Programming Languages:** GDScript (Godot), Python, C++, JavaScript, C#
- **Tools & Frameworks:** Godot Engine, MATLAB, Simulink, Databricks, Azure, Xilinx ISE
- **Design Tools:** Photoshop, Aseprite, Blender
- **Other:** PLC, Embedded Systems, AI, Machine Learning

## 🚀 Goals
- **Short-term:** Master Godot, create engaging games, and improve my coding skills  
- **Long-term:** Build a scalable game development business that merges my technical and creative expertise

## 🎨 Creative Side
When I'm not coding, I'm creating pixel art and game assets. I’ve taught **pixel art courses**, and my passion for creativity continues to grow through game design and **NFT art**.
